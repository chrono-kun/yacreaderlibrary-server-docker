# YACReaderLibrary Server Docker

Headless version of the [YACReaderLibraryServer](https://github.com/YACReader/yacreader/tree/develop/YACReaderLibraryServer). 

[YACReader](https://www.yacreader.com/) is the best comic reader and comic manager available, with support for cbr, cbz, zip, and rar comic files. 

YACReaderLibraryServer makes it easy to run a home comics server to serve your comics to any device running a YACReader client (including Windows, MacOS, Linux, and iOS).

## Setup Instructions:

Here are some examples to help you get started creating a container. If you are an UNRAID user you can access my [UNRAID YACReaderLibraryServer template](https://raw.github.com/xthursdayx/docker-templates/blob/master/yacserver.xml) in Community Apps.

### Docker CLI

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name=YACReaderLibraryServer \
  -e PUID=99 \
  -e PGID=100 \
  -e TZ=America/new_York \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  -v /path/to/config:/config \
  -v /path/to/comic:/comics \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  xthursdayx/yacreaderlibrary-server-docker
```

### docker-compose

Compatible with docker-compose v2 schemas.

```yaml
---
version: "2.1"
services:
  yacreaderlibraryserver:
    image: xthursdayx/yacreaderlibrary-server-docker
    container_name: YACReaderLibraryServer
    environment:
      - PUID=99
      - PGID=100
      - TZ=America/New_York
    volumes:
      - /path/to/config:/config
      - /path/to/comics:/comics
    ports:
      - 8080:8080
    restart: unless-stopped
```

### Parameters

Container images are configured using parameters passed at runtime (such as those listed above). These parameters are separated by a colon and indicate `<external>:<internal>` respectively. For example, `-p 8080:80` would expose port `80` from inside the container to be accessible from the host's IP on port `8080` outside the container. You can change the external/host port and volume mappings to suit your needs.

| Parameter | Function |
| :----: | --- |
| `-p 8080` | HTTP access to YACReaderLibraryServer. |
| `-e PUID=99` | for UserID - see below for more information. |
| `-e PGID=100` | for GroupID - see below for more information. |
| `-e TZ=America/New_York` | Specify a timezone to use, e.g. America/New_York. |
| `-v /config` | Directory where YACReaderLibraryServer's configuration and log files will be stored. |
| `-v /comics` | The directory where YACReaderLibraryServer will look for your comics. |

### User / Group Identifiers

When using volumes (`-v` flags) permissions issues can arise between the host OS and the container, you can avoid this by specifying the user `PUID` and group `PGID`.

Ensure any mapped volume directories on your host machine are owned by the same user you specify and you will avoid any permissions issues.

In this instance `PUID=99` and `PGID=100`, to find yours using the following command:

```bash
  $ id <username> # Replace with your username
    uid=99(nobody) gid=100(users) groups=100(users)
```   

## Usage Instructions:

#### To create a new YACReader comics library run the  following command from the CLI on your host machine, changing `<library-name>` as you wish:
````
docker exec yacserver YACReaderLibraryServer create-library <library-name> /comics
````
#### To add an existing YACReader library:
````
docker exec yacserver YACReaderLibraryServer add-library <library-name> /comics
````
#### To update your YACReader library (e.g. when you've added new comics):
````
docker exec yacserver YACReaderLibraryServer update-library /comics
````
#### To list all existing YACReader libraries
````
docker exec yacserver YACReaderLibraryServer list-libraries
````
#### To remove a YACReader library
````
docker exec yacserver YACReaderLibraryServer remove-library <library-name>
````

You can also view YACReaderLibraryServer's limited WebUI by pointing your web browser to: 

* `http://SERVERIP:8080` (Replace `SERVERIP` with the correct value). 

**Please note**: YACReaderLibraryServer does not have authentication installed by default, so it is not advisable to expose your server outside of your home network. If you wish to be able to access YACReaderLibraryServer from outside your local network please use a reverse ssl proxy, such as NGINX with an .htaccess file, or a locally-hosted VPN, such as OpenVPN to access your local network
